# Pet-Classification

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook implements a pet classification task using image data. The aim is to classify images of pets into their respective categories (e.g., dogs, cats, breeds).

## Features
1. Dataset Handling: Load and preprocess image datasets.
2. Model Development: Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for multiclass classification.
3. Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to evaluate performance.
4. Prediction: Predict pet categories for new image data.
